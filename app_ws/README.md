# Motivation 

As a volunteer firefighter, I respond to a lot of EMS calls even though I donâ€™t have formal EMS training. On many of these calls, I feel the gap between what I can do safely and what would help the patient or the incoming EMS crew. Right now, I rely on memory or quick notes, but it feels unstructured and easy to miss details. I want a way to better capture patient information and provide meaningful support without stepping outside my training. 

 

# Purpose 

The idea is a mobile app that: 

1. Guides non-EMS responders in collecting structured patient information and vitals. 

2. Provides safe, low-level care reminders rooted in established first aid and baseline EMS protocols. 

3. Generates a clear, shareable report to make handoffs to EMS teams smoother and more reliable. 

The goal is not to diagnose or replace EMS providers, but to bridge the gap between first-arrival responders and advanced care, while improving communication and consistency. 

 

## Scope of Care Examples 

The app would focus on non-consequential, low-risk interventions such as: 

* *Positioning*: recovery position, keeping stroke patients upright, elevating legs in suspected shock. 

* *Comfort measures*: covering for warmth, encouraging calm breathing, monitoring changes. 

* *Basic first aid*: bleeding control, burn cooling and dressing, immobilizing an injured limb. 

* *Protocol reminders*: FAST stroke check, noting last known well time, SAMPLE/OPQRST history prompts. 

* *Vital tracking*: structured entry for heart rate, breathing, and repeating over time. 

 

## Boundaries 

* No medication dosing or administration guidance. 

* No invasive procedures. 

* No diagnostic claims. 

* Framed strictly as checklists, reminders, and documentation tools.
